### To setup read-only git clone using deploy key without github account:   
[github collaborate will not give read-only access, so do that this way:]  
on windows pc:  
```
# this generates your own ssh key
# When asked, specify "./id_rsa123" as keyfile location. No password.
ssh-keygen -t rsa   
# Ask repo owner to setup above id_rsa123.pub file contents as a read-only 
# deploy key for the repo. This is done by leaving the "write permission" 
# box empty when adding deploy key
# Then on pc you run these [you need to run these at every login. See other  
# part of this doc to make it permanent]:    
# eval starts up the ssh agent. ssh-add tells it to eat your ssh key. 
# git clone works via the ssh agent to authenticate you to the github repo  
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"  
ssh-add  ./id_rsa123
git clone git@github.com:txtjqm/full-stack-docr.git   
# if done right, below push will fail.   
# git add .;  git commit -m 'read only user test';git push;
```
