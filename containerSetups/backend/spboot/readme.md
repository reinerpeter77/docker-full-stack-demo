This is the spring-boot project.
Todo: write docs for this level

The start page at http://localhost:8086 is plain html/javascript 
served by spring-boot and demonstrates calling web services and web
sockets from a browser client. 

Other notes:
to run manually, need to specify server.port as env variable:
java -Dserver.port=8086 -jar build/libs/spring-boot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
